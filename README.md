# Q-Team50-Produce101

Our project is an application for dish ordering and food recommendations in restaurants. Customers can perform various functions such as booking tables, searching food, ordering dishes, viewing recommendations, paying for the bill in discount, and so on. The highlight of our system is that it can help customers make decisions on dishes according to information like history purchases, current dishes, and dishes in order. The system also displays a vivid interface and provides functions like fuzzy search, and discount calculation to enhance customer experiences.

We plan to collect real-world data with a web crawler and generate some data we need. The system realizes the basic CRUD database operations and advanced features like procedure and trigger. We also put a UI mockup and our tentative work distribution in our proposal.
